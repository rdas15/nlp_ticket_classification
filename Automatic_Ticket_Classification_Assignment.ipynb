    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",

    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.   \n",
      "78310  I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.   \n",
      "78311                                                                                                                                                      I have had flawless credit for 30 yrs. I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.   \n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.   \n",

      "21    on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team\n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

                            with out notice jp morgan chase restricted my account by my debit card tuesday on thursday i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally thank you   \n",

   my chase amazon card was declined for a catering order i had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of i contacted chase around noon today and was asked the last numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user customer rep told me they would call me back in minutes to keep the line open i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor who said the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my card to pay for the order me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for hours called caterer card declined use a mastercard which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at pm tonight in the amount of it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the transaction never been declined by either chase or before today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear it never did   \n",

this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

pay on the gap insurancewaiver coverage that i purchased at the time i signed the financing agreement while stationed at i purchased a cadillac ats premium and financed the vehicle with chase auto finance when i purchased the vehicle the original financing agreement included an option to purchase gap insurance for an additional the provider of the gap insurance was however i was also required to sign a gap waiver addendum which stated that what was purchased was not insurance but an agreement for chase auto finance to waive any deficiency in the event the vehicle was totaled chase auto finance agreed in writing for me to ship my vehicle to when i received military orders reassigning me to the letter authorized me to drive the vehicle here in while i am stationed overseas the vehicle was totaled in an accident now chase is refusing to honor the gap insurancewaiver provisions because the loss occurred outside of the united states or they are also refusing to release the lien on the vehicle so that the salvage value can be recovered and sent to the bank i simply want chase bank to honor its commitment to cover the deficiency between the insurance payout and the remaining balance on the loan if the salvage value of is paid   \n",

information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the offer and she that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than after putting in the application on notwithstanding my request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n",

                            i made a purchase of on i made payments of on and on the minimum payment was the closing date was please see attached statement that statement shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on however when i got the statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance in of in the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully   \n",

bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info they showed that on the of i was very late on my bill and owed to bring this balance down to and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the to being it to they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",
